- 👀 I’m interested in ... I would like to work in an organization concerned with developing that culture of "Customer Satisfaction", 
so that that client returns for more than we do, either in a single place or we replicate it, if the company has several facilities 
in different places, for me there is no problem to travel, On the other hand, to have corporate transparency, in terms of five-year 
annual objectives in which the activity, performance, successes and failures of my teams must be visible to the rest of the company. 
I think an organization has to be compromised over meeting its goals, not the hours its employees spend inside a building

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Bachelor's Degree in Tourism Mention Gastronomy (in process). WHY.? because Tourism goes with Hospitality 
and Hospitality goes with Gastronomy and Gastronomy is what I like the most... from gastronomy I like to research on nutritionally healthy 
ingredients for our guests, offer a different menu every week, create recipes and dishes with those new ingredients and MAKE the client 
come back for more, that is, an unforgettable GASTRONOMIC EXPERIENCE.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... In a working group where we can create new things with the ingredients most demanded by the 
clientele of educated palates and those who are learning of educated palates and those who are learning to recognize about an 
unforgettable dining experience and want to know more about each preparation, origin and history, if each dish has its story to tell.
